The majority of the code is included in the "cpl" subdirectory.  "cpl" is also a python package, so imports are done like "from cpl import bundle", etc.

Within the cpl directory there are simply a number of Python files that correspond to each of the fortran files in the original CPL6 library.  For instance, cpl_comm_mod.F90 corresponds to comm.py, and cpl_domain_mod.F90 corresponds to domain.py.  

The fortran files (depending on whether they are being used) are usually set aside into the directories unused_f90 and used_f90 just to clean up the directory listings.  

The toplevel "pyCPL" directory contains a bunch of other stuff:
*.pgi files are all processor group inputs, they can be safely ignored.  They are useful if you get to the point that you want to try to run pyCPL.

There is an included executable named "xatm" which is a version of the CCSM dead atmosphere compiled with portland group 5.2 for mpich1_ethernet.  This executable should run fine on Jazz.  

To facilitate running models and the coupler there are some files:  *.stdin and *.nml(namelist) in this directory.  These files can be modified to change working directories for the models and things like that.

The main python file in the top level is (of course) "main.py".  It is
destined for greatness (i.e.: it is where the coupler would actually be
implemented) but currently it doesn't do much at all.

There are a few other python files that I've used for testing MPI startup
issues, like "hi.py" and "hello.py".  A very useful script called "genmph.py"
is included that is needed for the proper installation of pyCPL onto a new
machine.  "genmph.py", although it sounds like it's related to MPH, actually
builds creates a simple xml reference file needed by Babel.  Other python
files that were useful during the translation of fortran90 to python code are
sitting in the utilities directory.
