== Introduction ==

PyMCT consists of a suite of software packages necessary to build and run a Python Coupler like PyCCSM.
MCT is a high performance regridding and parallel communication package designed to address issues of coupling multiple scientific models on different scales and grids to one another.

== System Overview ==

PyMCT wraps the Fortran 90 MCT library and makes it available to Python Programmers.  This wrapping is not normally possible due to complex issues with the many different interpretations of the Fortran 90 standard.  However, a powrful tool, the CCA Babel project allowed us to address these issues and completely wrap the MCT functionality into Python.

== Components ==

The following components are necessary to build and use MCT and PyMCT

MCT:
  * MPI (we use MPICH2)
