# Installation instructions for PyMCT

= Introduction =
This goal of this document is to walk through the steps to configure, build, and install PyMCT and setup an environment for writing and running MCT programs in Python.

= Requirements =
=== Compilers and Languages ===
We expect you to have:
  * C Compiler
  * Fortran 90 Compiler (Portland Group Fortran is incompatible <link>!)
  * Java JDK
  * Python 2.4 or later

=== Libraries ===
  * MPI (We prefer MPICH2, but others should work)
  * MPI with Dynamic Library support enabled (--enable-sharedlibs configuration option)
  * NetCDF
If you do not know if you have any of the above software installed and properly configured on the system you intend to use for PyMCT you will need to install or reconfigure the missing or misconfigured packages before you can begin the installation of PyMCT.

= Installation = 

== Overview ==
=== Stage 0 ===
Stage 0 is useful for administrators looking to setup their machine to use PyMCT from a fresh installation.  If you do not have  necessary compilers or basic libraries you should start here.
