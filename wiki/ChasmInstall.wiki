== About Chasm ==
Blatently stolen from [http://chasm-interop.sourceforge.net/]:

Chasm is a language transformation system created to improve Fortran and C/C++ language interoperability. Chasm (with the aid of associated tools) parses Fortran and C/C++ source code and automatically generates bridging code that can be used to make calls to routines in the foreign language. Chasm also supplies an array-descriptor library that provides an interface between C and F90 assumed-shape arrays. This allows arrays to be created in one language and then passed to and used by the other (foreign) language.

== Step 1:  Obtaining the Chasm source ==

Chasm can be downloaded directly from [http://sourceforge.net/projects/chasm-interop/]

Download version 1.3 or later.

Once you have Chasm downloaded to a directory on your system (let's assume it's  /home/user/Sandbox/ again) you can extra the source like this:

{{{
$ pwd
/home/steder/Sandbox
$ ls
chasm_1.4.RC1.tar.gz
$ tar -zxf chasm_1.4.RC1.tar.gz 
$ ls     
chasm/  chasm_1.4.RC1.tar.gz
$ cd chasm
$ ls
aclocal.m4      configure*    doc/      INSTALL   Makefile.in  test/
bin/            configure.in  example/  interop/  README       xform/
configuration/  contrib/      include/  LICENSE   src/         xml/
}}}

== Step 2:  Configuring Chasm ==

{{{
$ ./configure
}}}

== Step 3:  Building and Installing ==

{{{
$ make
$ make install
}}}
