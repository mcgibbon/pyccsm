== CCSM ==

Assuming you have a CCSM built on your platform of choice, it's relatively straightforward to modify it to be compatible with our Python coupler.

The main difference between PyCCSM and CCSM is that MPH is not used for initialization.  Other then that the 2 codebases are identical.

Replacing MPH without own initialization routine is a 3 step process.  First, we add our initialization routine to the CCSM shared source.  Next, we copy the main program of each component model into our CCSM Case's _SourceMods_ directory and slightly modify the source to call the new initialization routine.  Finally, we recompile CCSM using the standard CCSM build system.
